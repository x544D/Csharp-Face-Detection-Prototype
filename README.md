***This is a simple prototype on an old FaceDetection system I was working on as way to login.***

> Test without compiling :
- Make sure you Camera is Activated and fully wotking and Not used by something else.
- The better the quality the perfect the detection is .
- Browse to 'FaceDet\bin\x86\Debug\'
- Double click 'FaceDet.exe'
- A Messagebox will show up , this is just basically saying nothing in the DB yet.
- Hit [START DET] Camera will turn ON.
- Write Name and hit [SAVE FACE]
- If you re-open the detection should works and Draw your name .

***NOTE That this was just a prototype , It was actually made To save Faces Automatically .***
